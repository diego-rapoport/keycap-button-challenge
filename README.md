# Cool button with only CSS
This is an attemp to make (Alvish Baldhas)[https://dribbble.com/alvish] button [https://dribbble.com/shots/25117095] with pure HTML and CSS.

## Why
It's fun, it's beautiful and it's a challenge I saw on (Youtube)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRx-aNrNe8].  
Actually I only saw 10s of the video because the button looked so neat that I wanted to try it out without seeing how they did it.
